## What Gets Removed and Why

### üö´ Security Threats

**Scripts and Code**
- **What:** `<script>`, `<iframe>`, `<object>`, `<embed>`
- **Why:** These can run malicious code that could steal information or harm other users
- **Alternative:** Use text descriptions instead

**Event Handlers**
- **What:** `onclick=""`, `onload=""`, `onerror=""`, etc.
- **Why:** These can trigger unwanted actions when users view your content
- **Alternative:** Our interface provides safe interactive elements

**External Links**
- **What:** `<a href="">`, `<link>`, external images

**Custom Classes and IDs**
- **What:** Most `class=""` and `id=""` attributes
- **Why:** These could interfere with page functionality
- **Alternative:** Use semantic HTML tags like `<strong>` and `<em>`

## Troubleshooting

### "My formatting disappeared!"

**Problem:** Your HTML formatting was removed after saving.

**Solutions:**
1. **Check allowed tags:** Make sure you're using supported formatting
2. **Avoid attributes:** Use simple tags like `<strong>` instead of `<span style="">`
3. **Check character limits:** Long content might be truncated
4. **Use proper nesting:** Make sure tags are properly opened and closed

**Example Fix:**
```html
<!-- Instead of this -->
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">Important text</span>

<!-- Use this -->
<strong>Important text</strong>
```

### "My content looks different than expected"

**Problem:** The formatting changed when you saved.

**Solutions:**
1. **Use semantic tags:** `<strong>` for important text, `<em>` for emphasis
2. **Check nesting:** Make sure tags are properly nested
3. **Simplify formatting:** Use basic formatting for best results

**Example Fix:**
```html
<!-- Instead of this -->
<div><span><b><i>Text</i></b></span></div>

<!-- Use this -->
<p><strong><em>Text</em></strong></p>
```

### "I got a security warning"

**Problem:** You received a message about content being blocked.

**What happened:** Our system detected potentially dangerous content and removed it for everyone's safety.

**What to do:**
1. **Review your content:** Look for any code-like text or special characters
2. **Use simple formatting:** Stick to basic HTML tags
3. **Contact support:** If you think this was a mistake, let us know!

### "My emojis disappeared"

**Problem:** Emojis or special characters were removed.

**Solution:** 
- Emojis are usually safe! Try copying and pasting them directly: üêïüê±üê∞
- Avoid emoji codes like `:dog:` in HTML contexts
- Some special Unicode characters might be filtered for safety

## Best Practices

### ‚úÖ Do This

1. **Keep it simple:** Use basic HTML tags for the best results
2. **Test as you go:** Save frequently to see how your formatting looks
3. **Use semantic HTML:** `<strong>` for important text, `<em>` for emphasis
4. **Write for humans:** Focus on clear, readable content
5. **Respect limits:** Stay within character limits for each section

### ‚ùå Avoid This

1. **Don't copy from websites:** Pasted HTML might contain unsafe elements
2. **Don't use complex nesting:** Keep your HTML structure simple
3. **Don't include links:** Use text descriptions instead
4. **Don't use custom CSS:** Stick to supported formatting options
5. **Don't include personal info:** Keep private information out of public content

### üí° Pro Tips

1. **Preview before saving:** Use the preview feature to see how your content will look
2. **Start simple:** Begin with plain text, then add formatting gradually
3. **Learn from examples:** Look at other users' well-formatted content for inspiration
4. **Use line breaks:** `<br>` tags help organize your content
5. **Be descriptive:** Good content doesn't need fancy formatting to be engaging
