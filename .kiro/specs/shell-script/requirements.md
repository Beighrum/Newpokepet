# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a shell script that automatically scaffolds a complete pet card generator project. The script generates a full project structure including documentation, Firebase functions, React components, and configuration files. This tool enables rapid project initialization with all necessary boilerplate code and documentation for a pet card generator application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run a single shell script that creates a complete pet card generator project structure, so that I can quickly start development without manually creating dozens of files and folders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the script is executed THEN the system SHALL create a root directory named "pet-card-generator"
2. WHEN the script runs THEN the system SHALL create the folder structure including functions, src/components, src/pages, and docs directories
3. WHEN the script completes THEN the system SHALL generate all necessary documentation files including Stage10-Closure.md and Complete-PRD.md
4. WHEN the script finishes THEN the system SHALL create functional Firebase Cloud Functions with generate.js and evolve.js endpoints
5. WHEN the script executes THEN the system SHALL create React components including Navbar.jsx and ImageCard.jsx
6. WHEN the script runs THEN the system SHALL generate page components including UploadPage.jsx and EvolutionPage.jsx
7. WHEN the script completes THEN the system SHALL create a comprehensive README.md with setup instructions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the generated project to include complete documentation, so that I understand the project scope, requirements, and setup process without additional research.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the script generates documentation THEN the system SHALL include a complete Product Requirements Document with vision, problem statement, and success metrics
2. WHEN documentation is created THEN the system SHALL include a Stage 10 closure document with deliverables, retrospective, and handoff checklist
3. WHEN the README is generated THEN the system SHALL include clear setup instructions with required environment variables
4. WHEN documentation is complete THEN the system SHALL provide deployment instructions for Firebase functions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the generated code to be functional and follow best practices, so that I can immediately start development or deployment without fixing basic issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Firebase functions are generated THEN the system SHALL include proper error handling and async/await patterns
2. WHEN React components are created THEN the system SHALL use modern React patterns with hooks and proper prop handling
3. WHEN API endpoints are generated THEN the system SHALL include proper request validation and response formatting
4. WHEN the project structure is created THEN the system SHALL follow standard Node.js and React project conventions
5. WHEN code files are generated THEN the system SHALL include necessary imports and dependencies

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the shell script to be robust and handle edge cases, so that it works reliably across different environments and scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the script starts THEN the system SHALL use "set -e" to exit on any command failure
2. WHEN creating directories THEN the system SHALL use "mkdir -p" to handle existing directories gracefully
3. WHEN writing files THEN the system SHALL use heredoc syntax to prevent shell interpretation issues
4. WHEN the script encounters errors THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and exit appropriately
5. WHEN running on different systems THEN the system SHALL use portable shell commands compatible with bash environments
