# Pet Upload Transformation Design

## Overview

This design enhances the existing upload page by integrating the comprehensive pet photo upload and transformation interface. The enhancement focuses on updating the current upload functionality with improved drag-and-drop capabilities, visual customization options, and better integration with the card generation system. The design maintains the existing page structure while upgrading the user experience with modern UI components and enhanced functionality.

### State Management
The component manages several key state variables:
- `selectedType`: Currently selected Pokemon type
- `selectedRarity`: User's rarity preference
- `selectedAppearance`: Chosen appearance style
- `selectedPersonalities`: Array of selected personality traits
- `uploadedFile`: File object for the uploaded image
- `imagePreview`: URL for image preview display
- `isDragging`: Drag state for visual feedback
- `isGenerating`: Loading state during generation process

- Shows spinner and "Generating..." text during processing
- Validates required inputs before allowing generation

### Store Card Component
**Purpose**: Provides access to premium features and gem purchases

## Data Models

### Pokemon Type Model
```typescript
interface PokemonType {
  id: string
  name: string
  icon: LucideIcon
  color: string // Tailwind CSS class
}
```

### Rarity Model
```typescript
interface Rarity {
  id: string
  name: string
  odds: string
  color: string // Tailwind CSS class
}
```

### Generation Request Model
```typescript
interface GenerationRequest {
  imageData: ArrayBuffer
  fileName: string
  fileType: string
  design: {
    type: string
    rarity: string
    appearance: string
    personalities: string[]
  }
  prompt: string
}
```

### Store Item Model
```typescript
interface StoreItem {
  id: string
  name: string

```

## Error Handling

### File Upload Validation
- Validate file type to ensure only images are accepted
- Display user-friendly error messages for invalid files
- Handle file size limitations gracefully
- Provide clear feedback for successful uploads

### Generation Process Errors
- Validate user authentication before allowing generation
- Require image upload before generation can proceed
- Handle network failures during generation process
- Display appropriate error messages with retry options

### Authentication Integration
- Check user authentication state using Firebase Auth
- Display sign-in prompts for unauthenticated users
- Handle authentication state changes gracefully
- Integrate with existing user session management

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Test file upload validation logic
- Verify personality trait selection/deselection
- Test form state management and validation
- Validate generation request payload construction

### Integration Testing
- Test drag-and-drop file upload functionality
- Verify Firebase function integration for card generation
- Test authentication flow integration
- Validate toast notification system integration

### User Experience Testing
- Test responsive layout across device sizes
- Verify drag-and-drop visual feedback
- Test loading states and error handling
- Validate accessibility compliance for all interactive elements

## Implementation Notes

### Styling Approach
- Maintain consistent glassmorphism design with backdrop-blur effects
- Use gradient backgrounds for page and promotional sections
- Implement proper color coding for types and rarities
- Ensure responsive design with appropriate breakpoints

### Performance Considerations
- Optimize image preview generation and cleanup
- Implement proper file URL management to prevent memory leaks
- Use efficient state updates for personality selection
- Lazy load store information when needed

### Integration Points
