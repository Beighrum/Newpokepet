# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves integrating DOMPurify (github.com/cure53/DOMPurify) into the existing pet card generator application to prevent XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks and sanitize user-generated content. The integration will ensure that any HTML content displayed in the application is properly sanitized, protecting users from malicious scripts while preserving safe HTML formatting.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: HTML Content Sanitization

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want all user-generated HTML content to be sanitized before display, so that malicious scripts cannot execute in users' browsers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user-generated content contains HTML THEN the system SHALL sanitize it using DOMPurify before rendering
2. WHEN malicious script tags are present in content THEN the system SHALL remove them completely
3. WHEN safe HTML formatting is present THEN the system SHALL preserve it after sanitization
4. WHEN content is sanitized THEN the system SHALL maintain the original text content and safe styling
5. WHEN sanitization fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to plain text display with error logging

### Requirement 2: Pet Card Metadata Sanitization

**User Story:** As a pet owner, I want to add custom names and descriptions to my pet cards safely, so that my content displays correctly without security risks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pet names contain special characters THEN the system SHALL sanitize them for safe display
2. WHEN pet descriptions contain HTML formatting THEN the system SHALL allow safe tags while removing dangerous ones
3. WHEN card metadata is saved THEN the system SHALL sanitize content before storage in Firestore
4. WHEN cards are displayed in the gallery THEN the system SHALL show sanitized metadata content
5. WHEN sharing cards THEN the system SHALL ensure shared content is properly sanitized

### Requirement 3: User Profile Content Sanitization

**User Story:** As a user, I want to customize my profile with safe HTML content, so that I can express myself while maintaining platform security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users update their display names THEN the system SHALL sanitize the input for XSS prevention
2. WHEN users add profile descriptions THEN the system SHALL allow safe HTML tags while blocking scripts
3. WHEN profile content is displayed THEN the system SHALL render sanitized HTML safely
4. WHEN user content is indexed THEN the system SHALL store sanitized versions in the database
5. WHEN profile updates fail sanitization THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 4: Comment and Social Features Sanitization

**User Story:** As a user sharing pet cards, I want to add comments and social interactions safely, so that community features remain secure from malicious content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users add comments to shared cards THEN the system SHALL sanitize all comment content
2. WHEN social sharing descriptions are generated THEN the system SHALL sanitize metadata for external platforms
3. WHEN users report inappropriate content THEN the system SHALL log both original and sanitized versions
4. WHEN community features are used THEN the system SHALL prevent XSS attacks through user interactions
5. WHEN content moderation occurs THEN the system SHALL work with pre-sanitized content

### Requirement 5: Configuration and Performance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want DOMPurify integration to be configurable and performant, so that security doesn't compromise user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN DOMPurify is configured THEN the system SHALL use a whitelist approach for allowed HTML tags
2. WHEN sanitization occurs THEN the system SHALL complete processing within 100ms for typical content
3. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize DOMPurify with secure default settings
4. WHEN sanitization rules need updates THEN the system SHALL allow configuration without code changes
5. WHEN performance monitoring runs THEN the system SHALL track sanitization processing times

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring of content sanitization, so that I can detect and respond to security threats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN malicious content is detected THEN the system SHALL log the incident with user context
2. WHEN sanitization errors occur THEN the system SHALL alert administrators while gracefully handling the failure
3. WHEN suspicious patterns are found THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting for the affected user
4. WHEN security events happen THEN the system SHALL integrate with existing Sentry monitoring
5. WHEN audit trails are needed THEN the system SHALL maintain logs of sanitization actions
